# .NET MAUI Email App
Email App based on the Microsoft Outlook mobile UI but written in .NET MAUI.

This project is a working fork from a blog post written by Matt Goldman for [.NET MAUI UI July](https://goforgoldman.com/posts/outlook-clone), but internally it is using the excellent [MailKitSimplified](https://github.com/danzuep/MailKitSimplified) library.
